# MentHealth

MentHealth is a play on words to provide Mentors for Mental Health. MentHealth is a web application designed to help individual struggling with their mental health find resources that have helped others with their mental health journey.

MentHealth is currently underworks, but will utilize React.js for the front-end, Node.js + Express.js for the backend, and Firestore for the database.
